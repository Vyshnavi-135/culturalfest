            <h2>Invincible of SOIREE</h2>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Discover the excitement of the "Invincible of SOIREE" challenge, a captivating technical quest designed to evaluate and enrich participant's expertise across a broad spectrum of technical subjects. This program enhances the knowledge of subjects encompassing computer science and engineering. Join us for the rewarding experience that goes beyond conventional boundaries and enhances your knowledge in the dynamic world of technology.</p>
           
            <h3>This program consists of the two stages:</h3>
            <h4>Prelims</h4>
            <p>It is a multiple-choice questions round. It contains 20 questions varying from general reasoning to the basic level of programming. All the participants are supposed to complete the prelims within 10 min.</p>
            <p><strong>No. of teams to be selected:</strong> 20</p>
           
            <h4>Mains</h4>
            <p>The mains consist of 4 rounds:</p>
           
            <h5>Round -1: Sudo Hash Chronicle</h5>
            <p><strong>Time allotted:</strong> 25 minutes</p>
            <p>This round is based on basic hash mapping and solving Sudoku. In this round, a hash function is given, and the key values are given in the puzzle (i.e., crossword), and the key value is processed through the hash function, and the hash values generated are used in solving the "Sudoku".</p>
            <p><strong>No. of groups to be selected:</strong> 10</p>
           
            <h5>Round -2: Tech Charades</h5>
            <p><strong>Time allotted:</strong> 40 minutes</p>
            <p>In this round, one of the team members is given a word, and he has to act and describe the given word while the other teammate tries to guess the given word.</p>
            <p><strong>No. of groups to be selected:</strong> 6</p>
           
            <h5>Round -3: Code Blitz</h5>
            <p><strong>Time allotted:</strong> 100 minutes</p>
            <p>This game starts with players solving a pool of questions for earning blitz points (BP). Once a team has a certain amount of points, the team will have access to the main question pool. Both members of the team can discuss and choose their main question (from the pool) and specify the question to volunteer. Once a question is chosen, that team will not be able to change their question. After choosing, the players can continue earning BP and now they can also start purchasing utilities using BP. When a team is ready with enough utilities, they can start coding the main problem. If a team wants a few more utilities than what they already purchased, they can purchase a few more at an increased price. The price is increased only if they've started coding the main problem. The fastest team to solve their selected question will be qualified.</p>
           
            <h5>Round -4: Byte Talks</h5>
            <p><strong>Time allotted:</strong> 20 minutes</p>
            <p>In this round, top teams will be competing for the title 'Invincible of SOIREE'. Each team will choose a random topic (Lucky dip). For each topic, there are a set of restricted keywords that shouldn't be used in their speech. Each team will have a few minutes of time for preparation to deliver their speech.</p>

      <h1>ROBO RACE</h1>
        <h5>(Open to all Branches)</h5>

        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Design a wired/wireless manually controlled robot which should be able to travel on land, sand, and water etc. The robot that traverses all the hurdles and completes the track in the minimum amount of time is declared as the 'DEATH RACE WINNER'.</p>

        <h3>Bot Specifications:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The dimensions of the vehicle must be within (40x40x40) cm.</li>
            <li>The robot can be wired/wireless. In case of wired control, the wires should be slack all the time.</li>
            <li>In case of wireless control, the RC should have two remote control circuits (or dual frequency remote control circuit/Bluetooth).</li>
            <li>The power supply for the vehicle should not exceed 12V DC between any two points in the circuit at any given time.</li>
            <li>Use of readymade chassis/RC Car is not allowed.</li>
            <li>Use of IC engine or compressor is not allowed.</li>
            <li>All robots must depend only on motors for their propulsion and control.</li>
            <li>The body of the vehicle must be covered to avoid any entanglement between two competing robots.</li>
            <li>Damaging the wires of an opponent will lead to disqualification.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Arena Specifications:</h3>
        <p>The robot has to traverse through a rough terrain of width 0.5 to 1m, surrounded by a barrier of height 20cm. The arena has 6 types of regions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Region 1:</strong> Speed breakers with a radius of 2.5cm.</li>
            <li><strong>Region 2:</strong> A pit of depth 10cm.</li>
            <li><strong>Region 3:</strong> A small portion filled with sand (depth 3cm).</li>
            <li><strong>Region 4:</strong> Elevated track with a 30-degree incline.</li>
            <li><strong>Region 5:</strong> Graveled path.</li>
            <li><strong>Region 6:</strong> Damp area filled with water (depth 3cm).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rules:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Teams must start their Robots from the starting line only after a signal is given by the Referee.</li>
            <li>Number of participants per team should not exceed 5.</li>
            <li>If the bot leaves the track or becomes immobile, it is considered a “PIT FALL.” Each pitfall spans for 1 minute, with the first three being penalty-free.</li>
            <li>Only two persons from a team can manipulate the bot during a pit fall.</li>
            <li>One hour before the event, the bot must go through a specification check.</li>
            <li>Misbehavior will lead to disqualification or a reduction in points.</li>
            <li>Any unfair practices will result in disqualification.</li>
            <li>The referee's decision is final.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Judging Criteria:</h3>
        <p>The time taken to complete the whole track is solely considered. The robot that completes the track in the least time is declared the winner. In case of a tie, factors such as the number of pitfalls will be considered.</p>
